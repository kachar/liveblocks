# v0.17.11

General:

- Fix a packaging bug

In **@liveblocks/react**:

- Deprecate an undocumented API

# v0.17.9

- Fix bug that could cause duplicate copies of @liveblocks/client to end up in
  final bundle, for certain bundler configurations.
- Fix bug where in some conditions the initial presence for a new connection
  would not come through to all existing clients in the room
- Various internal changes

# v0.17.8

### New history APIs ↩️ ↪️

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - Add `canUndo()` and `canRedo()` utilities to `room.history`
  - Add `"history"` event type to `room.subscribe()` to subscribe to the current
    user's history changes

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Add `useCanUndo()` and `useCanRedo()` hooks

---

# v0.17.7

- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:

  - Simplify zustand middleware integration with Typescript. `TPresence`,
    `TStorage`, `TUserMeta`, and `TRoomEvent` are now optional.

Note that `@liveblocks/zustand` does not work with zustand > v4 because v3 and
v4 have completely different type definitions. As soon as zustand v4 is out of
the RC phase, we will consider updating our middleware to work with the latest
version.

### Example

Let's take a look at our
[To-do list](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples/zustand-todo-list)
example. Without our middleware, the store would look like this:

```ts
import create from "zustand";

type State = {
  draft: string;
  isTyping: boolean;
  todos: Todo[];
  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;
  addTodo: () => void;
  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;
};

create<State>(/* ... */);
```

With our middleware, you simply need to move the `State` param at the middleware
level:

```ts
import create from "zustand";
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { middleware } from "@liveblocks/zustand";

const client = createClient({ /*...*/ });

type State = {
  draft: string;
  isTyping: boolean;
  todos: Todo[];
  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;
  addTodo: () => void;
  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;
};

create(
  middleware<State>(/* ... */, {
    client,
    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },
    storageMapping: { todos: true }
  })
);
```

If you want to type `others` presence, you can use the `TPresence` generic
argument on the middleware.

```ts

type Presence = {
  isTyping: true;
}

const useStore = create(
  middleware<State, Presence>(/* ... */, {
    client,
    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },
    storageMapping: { todos: true }
  })
);

// In your component
useStore(state => state.liveblocks.others[0].presence?.isTyping)
```

---

# v0.17.6

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Expose `RoomContext` in the return value of `createRoomContext()`

---

# v0.17.5

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Fix bug where changing the `key` argument of `useMap()`, `useList()`,
    `useObject()` did not resubscribe to updates correctly
  - Ignore changes to the `RoomProvider`'s initial presence/storage props on
    subsequent renders. This makes it behave closer to `useState(initialState)`

---

# v0.17.4

Fix missing documentation for hooks created via `createRoomContext()`.

---

# v0.17.1

Fix `@liveblocks/nodes` packaging.

---

# v0.17.0

For information, please read our
[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17).

### TypeScript improvements ✨

This release contains major TypeScript improvements. The recommended setup now
is that you define your own Presence and Storage types at the highest level
(i.e. where you set up the room). After that initial one-time setup, you will no
longer need to provide any extra type annotations anywhere for your Liveblocks
code! 🙌

To learn how to set that up, follow the instructions in our
[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17).

- No more `any` types used (in `@liveblocks/client` and `@liveblocks/react`)
- All APIs that work with Presence data will now require it to be
  JSON-serializable
- All APIs that work with Storage data will now require it to be LSON (= JSON +
  Live structures)
- All Live structures now take mandatory type params for their payloads, just
  like the built-in array, object, and map types do:
  - `LiveMap<K, V>` (like `Map<K, V>`)
  - `LiveObject<{ a: number, b: string }>` (like, for example,
    `{ a: number, b: string }`)
  - `LiveList<T>` (like `Array<T>`)

### React Native support ✨

We now support React Native! To learn how to use Liveblocks in your React Native
projects, see our
[API reference](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientReactNative).
It's surprisingly simple!

### New APIs ✨

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - [`createRoomContext()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#createRoomContext)
    is now the preferred way to initialize hooks.

- In the API:

  - New endpoint to
    [Get Users in a Room](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRoomUsers)
  - New endpoint to
    [Get a list of all Rooms](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRooms)

### Bug fixes 🐛

- Improved conflict resolution on LiveList
- Various minor internal bug fixes

### Breaking changes

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - Removed old `Room.unsubscribe()` API

### New deprecations

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - The `defaultPresence` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to
    `initialPresence`
  - The `defaultStorageRoot` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to
    `initialStorage`
  - Calling `new LiveMap(null)` will stop working. Please use `new LiveMap()`,
    or `new LiveMap([])`

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Importing the React hooks directly is deprecated, instead use the new
    `createRoomContext()` helper. For help, read the
    [Recommended Upgrade Steps section](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17#recommended-upgrade-steps)
    within our [Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17)
  - The second argument to `useList()`, `useObject()`, and `useMap()` is
    deprecated
  - The RoomProvider's `defaultPresence` is renamed to `initialPresence`
  - The RoomProvider's `defaultStorageRoot` is renamed to `initialStorage`

#### `LiveList.set`

Set one element at a specified index.

list.set(0, "🐺");
list.toArray(); // equals ["🐺", "🦊", "🐵"]
```

https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/147 for more information

⚠️ **_Before using `LiveList.set`, you need to make sure that all connected
clients are using `0.16.0`. If a client is connected to a room with version
`< 0.16`, `LiveList.set` might lead to slightly unexpected behavior._**

### TypeScript improvements

@nvie improved our typescript definitions! They are more precise and restrictive
(for your own good :)). If typescript errors appears after upgrading to `0.16.0`
and they are not clear, please create a Github issue and we'll help you.
